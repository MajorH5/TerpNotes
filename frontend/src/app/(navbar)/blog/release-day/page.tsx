                            Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the launch of TerpNotes, a note-sharing platform built by students, for students. Our goal is simple: make studying easier by giving you access to shared notes across various courses, professors, and semesters. Whether youâ€™re looking to get ahead in your studies or catch up on missed content, TerpNotes is your go-to resource.

                        <p className="text-md text-justify indent-12">
                            The idea behind TerpNotes originated from the frustrations of students trying to find reliable and high-quality notes. Our team, made up of UMD students, understood that note-sharing could be more efficient, which led us to build this platform. With TerpNotes, you can contribute to the community by sharing your notes and help others succeed in their studies.

                            In this first version, weâ€™ve focused on providing students with a clean and intuitive interface for browsing notes.

Youâ€™ll also find a comment section under each note for peer discussions.
